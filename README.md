# 🧠 Create Memes

A simple React app built with **Vite** that lets you generate random meme templates and add your own top and bottom text.

This project was created **for learning purposes only** as part of a React fundamentals practice.  
All meme templates are fetched from the **free [Imgflip API](https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes)**.

This project does not store, redistribute, or modify meme images beyond displaying them directly from Imgflip.
It is intended solely as a frontend development learning exercise.
